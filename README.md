## üìã Debug and Analyze 

> Warning: Debug mode must be acitvated

First, we activate debug mode on SW1.1 by following these steps:

1. Press the **Power-Button**, scroll down, and choose **Settings**
2. Scroll down to **About Device**
3. Locate **SN No.** and press it 10 times continuously
4. Press the **Back-Button**
5. Press and hold the **Settings** label until "TestTools" opens, then activate the toggle for **Debuggable**
   
using Android Debug Bridge to check the devices on the watch including all type of sensors: 

1. ```adb shell```
2. ```getevent -i```
3. noting the device name -**sc** stands for **s**tep-**c**ounter :
 "GR5515-**sc** device 9: /dev/input/event4"
4. ``` getevent /dev/input/event4 ```
5. Shake the device to initiate the step counter sensor due to movement and check the output on the terminal

‚ö†Ô∏è Note: While shaking the device can initiate the step counter sensor, it's essential to understand that the step-counter sensor is optimized to capture movements from activities like walking or running. These activities have more distinct patterns compared to random shaking. For more accurate testing, it's recommended to walk or run rather than shake the device.
